# minigrid pulls in pygame transitively (minigrid.core.world_object), so pygame
# is a hard dependency of the API even though pyproject lists it only under the
# optional "visual" extra. Its manylinux wheel bundles SDL, but SDL still tries
# to open a display and an audio device at import unless told there are none.
# Without these two the image builds clean and dies on first boot.

# The first-party modules the API actually loads. This list is not guesswork -
# it is what `sys.modules` contains after importing demo.api.app and calling
# list_r1_tasks(). The chain reaches further than it looks: demo -> interface
# -> interface.coords -> prompting_experiments, and interface pulls pipeline
# and scorer behind that.
#
# demo/data/ carries the vendored R1 results table; there is no sibling
# Multinet-v2-results checkout inside an image and R1ResultCatalog raises
# FileNotFoundError without it. The R1 manifest resolves all 42 playable tasks
# under ogbench/ogbench/procgen/maze_jsons/ (same corpus as local dev).
