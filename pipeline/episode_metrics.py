"""Stage-3 instrumentation: derive test-2/test-3 signals from an episode log.

Pure post-processing over the ``interface/`` runner's ``episode.json`` (the dict
returned by ``ExperimentRunner.run`` and flushed by ``flush_episode_log``), the
task spec, the canonical paths, and the manifest row. No runner edits required:
each ``kind == "step"`` transcript record already carries ``event_type`` and a
``state_after`` snapshot with the mechanism id sets and agent ``(x, y)`` position.

Coordinate convention: positions here are ``(x, y)`` taken from
``state_after.agent_position`` (NOT the ``(row, col)`` ``position_after`` field),
matching the planner positions in ``canonical_paths.json``.
